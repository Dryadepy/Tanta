# Tanta
This purpose of this project is to provide documentation and code samples which will enable people to develop applications for Windows Media Foundation in the C# language.

Normally, WMF is considered to be a C++ tool - however the full functionality of Windows Media Foundation is available to users of the C# language via the very capable open source MF.Net interface library.

Using C# and MF.Net you can source streams of media data, render those streams to the screen or save them to files. You can also manipulate the data as it passes through the Media Pipeline and make whatever changes to it you wish. The full debugging capabilities of Visual Studio are also available so you can step through your C# code to observe its operation.

The Tanta project has two parts: a free book (in pdf format) which provides detailed "get started" information and a series of C# Sample Projects which illustrate various WMF Concepts.
